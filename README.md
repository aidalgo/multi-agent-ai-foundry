# Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine - Console Demo

Welcome to the *Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine* console demonstration, designed to showcase how AI agents can automate complex organizational tasks through an interactive command-line interface. This console demo provides a hands-on way to explore AI-driven orchestration systems that coordinate multiple specialized agents to accomplish various business processes.

When dealing with complex organizational tasks, users often face significant challenges, including coordinating across multiple departments, maintaining consistency in processes, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

The Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine console demo allows users to input tasks through an interactive console and see how they are automatically processed by a group of AI agents, each specialized in different aspects of business operations.

Demo overview
</h2>

This console demo leverages Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Foundry to create an intelligent automation pipeline through an interactive command-line interface. It demonstrates a multi-agent approach where specialized AI agents work together to plan, execute, and validate tasks based on user input.

**üéØ This is a demonstration application designed for:**
- Learning about multi-agent AI systems
- Exploring Azure AI capabilities
- Prototyping automation workflows
- Understanding agent coordination patterns

Getting started
</h2>

### üöÄ Run the Console Demo

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription with Azure OpenAI access
- Python 3.8+
- Azure CLI

**Quick Start:**
1. Set up your Azure resources (Azure OpenAI + AI Foundry)
2. Configure your environment
3. Run the console application

[ÔøΩ **Complete Setup Guide**](./SETUP.md)

### üí° Try Sample Prompts
Once running, try these examples:
- "Launch a new marketing campaign"
- "Help me onboard a new employee"
- "Plan a product launch strategy"

[üìù **More Examples**](./docs/SampleQuestions.md)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note: Azure OpenAI Quota**
 <br/>Make sure you have sufficient Azure OpenAI quota in your subscription. You can check your quota in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.

<br/>

### Requirements and Costs

**Azure Requirements:**
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with permissions to create resources
- Access to Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure AI Foundry project

**Supported Regions:**
East US, East US2, Japan East, UK South, Sweden Central (check [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) for current availability)

**Cost Structure:**
This console demo uses pay-per-use Azure services:

| Service | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) | Powers the AI agents | [Usage-based pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) |
| [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) | Agent project infrastructure | [Minimal project costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning/) |

üí° **Cost Tip:** Since this runs locally, you only pay for AI model usage during console sessions.

Business Scenario
</h2>

### üéØ Console Demo Experience

**The Challenge:**
Imagine you're a business manager who needs to coordinate a complex project that involves multiple departments. Traditionally, this would require:
- Scheduling meetings with HR, Marketing, Product teams
- Manually tracking action items across departments  
- Ensuring consistent communication and follow-up
- Managing dependencies between different workstreams

**The Console Demo:**
Instead, you simply open a terminal and type:
```
> "Help me launch a new marketing campaign for our Q2 product release"
```

**What Happens Next:**
1. **Planner Agent** analyzes your request and creates a coordinated plan
2. **Marketing Agent** suggests campaign strategies and channels
3. **Product Agent** provides technical specifications and positioning
4. **HR Agent** identifies team resource needs
5. **Procurement Agent** estimates budget requirements
6. **All agents coordinate** to deliver a comprehensive, actionable plan

### üíº Real-World Applications
